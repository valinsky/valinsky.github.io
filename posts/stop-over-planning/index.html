<p>Planning is an essential aspect of a healthy lifestyle. We try to systematically structure our daily activities in order to take full advantage of our time.<br />
For me it wasn&rsquo;t that simple. Planning often turned out to be a productivity killer and a cause for stress. I realized that was because I didn&rsquo;t know how my mind worked and I didn&rsquo;t know how to adapt to it.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-t-plan-inspiration">You can&rsquo;t plan inspiration</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re all living that busy 21st century life, trying to find a balance between family, partners, work, gym, nutrition, finances, school, friends, hobbies, hustling, side projects, lazyness, vacations, unforseen events, etc. Trying to order the modern hectic life by planning every detail would seem like a good&hellip; plan.</p>

<p>And it is.<br />
We need to plan out our life in order to fully experience it, but we also need to experience life in order to plan it.</p>

<p>Alex Ellis wrote a <a href="https://alexanderell.is/posts/trust-in-your-unconscious/">great post</a> about how the human mind works in the background. He goes into detail about the <em>focused</em> and <em>diffuse</em> modes of thinking, mainly how our mind works when we actively think about a problem and when we let it wander.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The focused mode is for filling your mind with information, and the diffuse mode is great at processing that information, forming connections between existing concepts, and developing new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In diffuse mode, while we are not actively thinking about a particular problem, our mind is capable of coming up with fresh and new solutions to problems we were previously struggling with.</p>

<p>In the article he quotes Dan Rockmore from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/the-myth-and-magic-of-generating-new-ideas">The Myth and Magic of Generating New Ideas</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s just a feeling of being free, of forgetting for a moment that we are bound by gravity and logic and convention, of letting the magic happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One thing I realized is that this magical inspiration is impossible to plan.</p>

<p>We need to trust our unconscious in order to overcome this beautiful uncertainty.</p>

<h3 id="the-dilemma">The dilemma</h3>

<p>Today I planned on going to the gym Monday, Wednesday and Friday next week. Wednesday comes, and all of a sudden I have a great idea for that project I haven&rsquo;t worked on in a while.</p>

<p>My mind was continuously connecting mental dots in the diffuse mode, and now I feel inspired. These <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect"><code>AHA!</code></a> moments are some of the best moments in life.</p>

<p>The problem is that when my past self created this plan, it didn&rsquo;t take into account how my present self will feel. That&rsquo;s impossible.
Now I have to make a choice. Either stick to the plan, or ride this impromptu inspiration train and see where it leads.</p>

<p>The choice between the plan my past self created for me, and where my current self is leaning towards can be intimidating. It&rsquo;s a cause for stress - <em>oh fuck I planned on doing X, but I want to do Y now, but if I do Y, I won&rsquo;t do X</em>. A bad choice can easily kill my productivity because I&rsquo;ll be forcing something that doesn&rsquo;t come natural to me.</p>

<h3 id="planning-is-a-tool">Planning is a tool</h3>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer? The answer is that planning is just another <strong>tool</strong> in our arsenal. We have to learn how to use it, not be used by it.</p>

<p>I think that flexibility and adaptability are crucial in letting discipline guide you towards your goals, short term and long term.</p>

<p>My long term goal is to be fit and healthy, not to conform to the fictional mental bariers my mind created for me which it now falsely interprets as discipline.</p>

<p>I think that we need to create personal standards for ourselves, to grow and identify with these standards, and when the time is right, to break free from them. <strong>Kill your master.</strong></p>

<p>With this in mind, the answer I found to the above dilemma is to let today be a resting day, adapt by creating a short term goal of seeing where my current inspiration takes me, and tomorrow go and kill it at the gym. I may not even make it to the gym tomorrow, who knows. Maybe do some pushups at home. Either way, I won&rsquo;t loose track of the long term goal.</p>

<p>The realization that you always have a choice and that you&rsquo;re not bound by your own stories feels like that huge metaphorical weight being lifted of off your chest. Feels like freedom.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-tool">Using the tool</h3>

<p>I used to try and finish every book I started, even if I didn&rsquo;t like it that much. Even if it took months, or years. Sometimes it started feeling like chore.<br />
Now I can easily start reading a new book while I&rsquo;m reading another book. Sometimes I bounce between 4 or 5 books. When I want to read about a particular subject, I find the book about that and continue where I left off. Or reread a chapter. It&rsquo;s not even about finshing the book anymore, it&rsquo;s about understanding concepts.</p>

<p>Planning doesn&rsquo;t mean to always stick to whatever stories your mind created in the past. I can come back to reading book X anytime.</p>

<p>Another example would be when we try to do to many things in a short amount of time. That can be a big cause for stress.<br />
Without understanding how my mind worked I was easily trapped in self guilt because of the fantasies my past self created - <em>I&rsquo;ve planned to do all these things today, if I don&rsquo;t do them I will feel bad and useless.</em></p>

<p>That sense of guilt is useless. I&rsquo;m learning how to prioritize and how to be fully engaged in what I choose to do, while understanding and trusting the power of my - conscious and unconscious - mind.</p>

<p>This concept should be familiar with software engineers. Software, requirements, technologies, libraries, etc. change all the time and at such a rapid pace that flexibility and adaptability are crucial skills to have. Just because you planned on coding this new feature today, a whole lot of things can happen that can stop you from doing that.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>I created this website long before I actually started writing anything. I didn&rsquo;t feel like it was the right moment yet, even though I wanted to have my own blog for a long time. I didn&rsquo;t force it. I could see thoughts of guilt and stress trying to creep up into my mind - <em>your website is ready and you didn&rsquo;t write anything yet! looser.</em> But I didn&rsquo;t give in to those feelings. You have to keep that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PkrhH-bkpk">monkey mind</a> in check.</p>

<p>Of course, every situation is different and you may need to think more about what to do next. That&rsquo;s fine. This life is nuts anyway. Just don&rsquo;t let plans intervene with your growth. Where there is a will there is, at least, a way. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ">Be water</a>.</p>
