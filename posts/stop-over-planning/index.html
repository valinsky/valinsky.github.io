                <p><del>Over</del>Planning can be a productivity killer and it can increase your stress.</p>

<p>Yes, we&rsquo;re all living that busy 21st century life, trying to find a balance between family, partners, work, gym, nutrition, finances, school, friends, hobbies, hustling, side projects, lazyness, vacations, unforseen events, etc. Trying to order the modern hectic life by planning every detail would seem like a good&hellip; plan.</p>

<p>And it is.<br />
You need to plan out your life in order to fully experience it, but you also need to experience life in order to plan it.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t plan inspiration.</p>

<p>Alex Ellis wrote a <a href="https://alexanderell.is/posts/trust-in-your-unconscious/">great post</a> about how the human mind works in the background. This paragraph in particular caught my attention, detailing an idea from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn">Learning How To Learn</a> by Barbara Oakley:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of my biggest takeaways from the course was the balance between actively focusing and letting your mind wander, or the focused and diffuse modes of thinking. The focused mode is for filling your mind with information, and the diffuse mode is great at processing that information, forming connections between existing concepts, and developing new ideas.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Example 1: Let&rsquo;s say that today you plan on going to the gym tomorrow evening. Tomorrow evening comes, and all of a sudden you have a great idea for that side project you haven&rsquo;t worked on in a while. When the past you created this plan, it didn&rsquo;t take into account how the present you will feel. That&rsquo;s impossible.</p>

<p>Your mind was continuously connecting mental dots in the diffuse mode, and now all of a sudden you&rsquo;re inspired. Those <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_effect"><code>AHA!</code></a> moments are some of the best moments in life.</p>

<p>Now you have to make a choice. Either stick to the plan, or ride this impromptu inspiration train and see where it leads.</p>

<p>The choice between the plan your past self created for you, and where your current self is leaning towards can be intimidating. It can cause you stress - <em>oh fuck I planned on doing X, but I want to do Y now, but if I do Y, I won&rsquo;t do X</em>. If chosen incorrectly, it could kill your productivity because you try to force something that doesn&rsquo;t come natural to you, because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the plan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So what&rsquo;s the answer? The answer is that planning is just another tool in your arsenal. Learn how to use it, don&rsquo;t let yourself be used by it.</p>

<p>Planning is an art.</p>

<p>Learn how to plan your activities and how to increase your flexibility and adaptability while letting discipline guide you towards your goals.</p>

<p>Discipline doesn&rsquo;t mean you always have to stick to whatever stories your mind creates.</p>

<p>Your goal is to be healthy, to break your boundaries and to have a killer body, not to conform to the fictional mental bariers your mind created for you which it now falsely interprets as discipline.<br />
Discipline yourself by creating personal standards, then break out of those standards. Kill your master.<br />
Use your time wisely. Let today be a resting day, see where your current inspiration takes you, and tomorrow go kill it at the gym.</p>

<p>Example 2: You&rsquo;re currently reading book X, and your friend vigorously talks about book Y.<br />
If your friend inspired you to read Y, don&rsquo;t wait to finish X first. Fulfill your curiosity. Start reading Y, and if it blows your mind, finish it. Or don&rsquo;t. Or start a different book altogether. The choice is yours. You can return to X anytime.</p>

<p>Example 3: Trying to do to many things in a short amount of time. That can be a big cause for stress.<br />
Use your mind to grow, not to get trapped in whatever fantasies your past self created - <em>I&rsquo;ve planned to do all these things today, if I don&rsquo;t do them I will feel bad and useless.</em><br />
Prioritize, be fully engaged in what you choose to do and do it right.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ">Live in the moment. Be present. Learn. Adapt.</a></p>

<p>I created this website long before I actually started writing anything. I didn&rsquo;t feel like it was the right time yet, even though I wanted to have my own blog for a long time. I didn&rsquo;t force it. I could see thoughts of guilt and stress trying to creep up into my mind - <em>your website is ready and you didn&rsquo;t write anything yet! looser.</em> But I didn&rsquo;t give in to those feelings. You have to keep that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PkrhH-bkpk">monkey mind</a> in check.</p>

<p>Of course, every situation is different and you may be put in delicate situations where you need to think more about what to do next. That&rsquo;s fine. This life is nuts anyway. Just don&rsquo;t let plans intervene with your growth.<br />
Where there is a will there is - at least - a way.</p>
