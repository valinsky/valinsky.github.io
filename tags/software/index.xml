      <description>One of my latest adventures in the world of software was to update the CI/CD for one of our repositories. The plan was to move away from using Jenkins in favor of a full CI/CD GitLab pipeline.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Jenkins for a few years and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a solid CI/CD and build tool. It&amp;rsquo;s highly configurable and it will get the job done.
It also needs maintenance. You have to run and configure a Jenkins server, which adds up to the (probably) high list of apps that need to be maintained.</description>
