      <description>Planning is an essential aspect of a healthy lifestyle. We try to systematically structure our daily activities in order to take full advantage of our time.
For me it wasn&amp;rsquo;t that simple. Planning often turned out to be a productivity killer and a cause for stress. I realized that was because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how my mind worked and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to adapt to it.
You can&amp;rsquo;t plan inspiration We&amp;rsquo;re all living that busy 21st century life, trying to find a balance between family, partners, work, gym, nutrition, finances, school, friends, hobbies, hustling, side projects, lazyness, vacations, unforseen events, etc.</description>
