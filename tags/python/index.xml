      <description>I was writing a lambda function which, among other things, was supposed to read a csv file from S3, perform some validation on every row, then use boto3 to perform an S3 multipart upload.
I created a wrapper class around the multipart upload functionality and I was using it inside the lambda_handler.
class S3MultipartUploader: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Wrapper class around the S3 multipart upload functionality. &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; def __init__(self, key: str, multipart_id: str = None, parts: List = []) -&amp;gt; None: self.</description>

To commemorate this event, I thought about creating a Twitter bot that keeps track of how many blocks are left until the next halving.</description>
