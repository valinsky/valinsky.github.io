      <description>On the 11th of May, 2020, at block height 630.000, the 3rd Bitcoin halving event happened.
For us Bitcoin nerds this was a huge event, not only because it happens every 4 years or because of its economic implications, but also because it shows the beautiful system that Bitcoin has in place, a system that has been working flawlessly since 2009.
To commemorate this event, I thought about creating a Twitter bot that keeps track of how many blocks are left until the next halving.</description>

      <title>Bloxplorer</title>

      <description>In this post I want to introduce Bloxplorer, a simple yet very effective Bitcoin and Liquid blockchain explorer I wrote in Python.
Bloxplorer - short for Block Explorer - is an open source package that allows developers to make use of the full power of the Blockstream Esplora HTTP API through a clean Python interface.
Why I wrote Bloxplorer I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated with Bitcoin, both from a technological and an economical standpoint, and with the ever growing pieces of tech surrounding it, like Lighting Network, Schnorr and Taproot to name a few.</description>

      <title>The Beauty of Building Software</title>

      <description>One of my latest adventures in the world of software was to update the CI/CD for one of our repositories. The plan was to move away from using Jenkins in favor of a full CI/CD GitLab pipeline.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Jenkins for a few years and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a solid CI/CD and build tool. It&amp;rsquo;s highly configurable and it will get the job done.
It also needs maintenance. You have to run and configure a Jenkins server, which adds up to the (probably) high list of apps that need to be maintained.</description>

      <title>Privacy Build 2020</title>

      <description>Privacy was a hot topic in the last decade. And for good reason. Corporations are thriving based on the business model of gathering as much data as they can from their customers and using that data to gain influence and to generate profit.
Companies started employing intelligent and invasive tracking methods to gather as much user data as possible while hiding the underlying techniques implemented through intelligent word play. A lot of people have no idea how their data is being used, or that they themselves have become a product.</description>

      <title>The Magic of Quake 3&#39;s Fast Inverse Square Root Explained</title>

      <description>This is one of those magical unicorn algorithms.
I was always intrigued by this small piece of code, because it&amp;rsquo;s such a unique and elegant solution to a common problem, and it&amp;rsquo;s part of a game I played a lot as a kid. I did not understand it then, but I do now.
This algorithm estimates the inverse square root, \( 1 / \sqrt{number} \), of a positive 32 bit floating point number.</description>

      <description>You can use your own custom domain with GitHub Pages, instead of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io domain. This GitHub Pages post covers the domain configuration steps.
If you bought the domain on GoDaddy, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you the exact GoDaddy DNS configuration you need.
Go to your godaddy.com domain, and find the Manage DNS option.
