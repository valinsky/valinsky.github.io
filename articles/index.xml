      <description>I was writing a lambda function which, among other things, was supposed to read a csv file from S3, perform some validation on every row, then use boto3 to perform an S3 multipart upload.
I created a wrapper class around the multipart upload functionality and I was using it inside the lambda_handler. The code is simplified for brevity.
class S3MultipartUploader: &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; Wrapper class around the S3 multipart upload functionality. &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; def __init__(self, key: str, multipart_id: str = None, parts: List = []) -&amp;gt; None: self.</description>

      <title>CalyxOS</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using CalyxOS for about a month on a Pixel 4a and I love it.
It feels so liberating to use a mobile FOSS OS without all the privacy intruding Google spyware.
Apps While transitioning to CalyxOS I realized I was using many apps that I didn&amp;rsquo;t really need. This was the perfect time get rid of them. The less apps you have on your phone the better.
The apps that I ended up still using work well on CalyxOS.</description>

      <description>On the 11th of May, 2020, at block height 630.000, the 3rd Bitcoin halving event happened.
For us Bitcoin nerds this was a huge event, not only because it happens every 4 years or because of its economic implications, but also because it shows the beautiful system that Bitcoin has in place, a system that has been working flawlessly since 2009.
To commemorate this event, I thought about creating a Twitter bot that keeps track of how many blocks are left until the next halving.</description>

      <title>The Square Root of Quake 3</title>

      <description>This is one of those crazy algorithms.
This algorithm estimates the inverse square root, \( 1 / \sqrt{number} \), of a positive 32 bit floating point number.
Nowadays programmers might think to solve this problem by simply importing a library and calling a function.
But back in 1999 the Quake 3 Arena developers realized it was computationally expensive to calculate the inverse square root of a floating point number on a large scale using traditional methods.</description>

      <description>You can use your own custom domain with GitHub Pages, instead of GitHub&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.github.io domain. This GitHub Pages post covers the domain configuration steps.
If you bought the domain on GoDaddy, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you the exact GoDaddy DNS configuration you need.
Go to your godaddy.com domain, and find the Manage DNS option.
GoDaddy Manage DNS  Add these settings.
